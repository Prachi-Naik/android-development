#Project Domain: Education

#Project Name: Career_Plus

Problem: Choosing a career after Intermediate in which you have to spend your whole life is a daunting task. We always try to do our
best but there is always a fear of being wrong.There are also cases in which students realise leaning towards another stream after
admission or one/two years of college.Even in High School there is confusion in what stream to choose. Choosing a career is not only
stressful and cumbersome for studentsbut also parents. One wrong decision and their lives direction is altered.Apart from that there 
is also misinformation about many careers and there are people who benefit from these things and try to trick students into taking
their products.


Proposed Solution: For the above problem we are proposing to provide a platform that can provide all the needed information for
different career options from which a student can choose. The features of our proposed applications are:
1.We will provide all the necessary information for different career options.
2.We will suggest the user about which career, stream or branch to choose according to their interest and a personalized test.
3.We will provide connections between students and the real and trusted education counselor.
4.We will also be providing the important resources for students and detail about available scholarships.
5.Application will also contain information about different entrance exams and what they can expect if they choose to take admission.
6.All the main information will be reviewed by the team for fake things and other information will be peer reviewed .
